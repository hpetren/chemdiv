\title{Calculate sample dissimilarities}
\usage{
sampleDis(sampleData, compDisMat = NULL, type = "BrayCurtis", alpha = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampleData}{Data frame with samples as rows and compounds as columns.}

\item{compDisMat}{Compound dissimilarity matrix, as calculated by
\code{\link{compDis}}. If this is supplied, Generalized UniFrac
dissimilarities can be calculated.}

\item{type}{Type of sample dissimilarity to be calculated. This is
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, \code{BrayCurtis} and/or Generalized UniFrac
dissimilarity, \code{GenUniFrac}.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha value used to calculate Generalized UniFracs. alpha can
be set between 0 and 1. With alpha = 0 equal emphasis is put on every
branch in the dendrogram. With values closer to 1, more emphasis is put
on high abundance branches. alpha = 0.5 strikes a balance.
alpha 0.5 or 1 is recommended, with alpha = 1 as default.}
}
\value{
List with sample dissimilarity matrices. A list is always
outputted, even if only one matrix is calculated.
}
\description{
Function to calculate dissimilarities between samples.
This is either Bray-Curtis dissimilarities and/or Generalized UniFrac
dissimilarities.
}
\details{
\code{sampleDis} calculates a dissimilarity matrix for all the samples
in \code{sampleData}. Bray-Curtis dissimilarities are calculated using only
the \code{sampleData}. If a compound dissimilarity matrix, \code{compDisMat},
is supplied, Generalized UniFrac dissimilarities can also be calculated,
which uses the compound dissimilarity matrix (transformed into a dendrogram)
in the dissimilarity calculations. Thereby, the biosynthetic/structural
properties of the compounds is taken into account for the calculations
of sample dissimilarities.
