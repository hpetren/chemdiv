\title{Calculate various diversity/evenness measures}
\usage{
calcDiv(sampleData, compDisMat = NULL, type = "HillDiv", q = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampleData}{Dataframe with samples as rows and compounds as columns.}

\item{compDisMat}{Compound dissimilarity matrix, as calculated by
\code{\link{compDis}}. Has to be supplied for
calculations of Functional Hill diversity, Rao's Q and FAD.}

\item{type}{Type(s) of diversity or evenness to calculate. Any of
\code{"HillDiv", "FuncHillDiv", "Shannon", "Simpson", "PielouEven",
"HillEven", "RaoQ", "FAD"}.}

\item{q}{Diversity order to use for (Functional) Hill diversity. q should
be equal to or larger than zero. This parameter determines the sensitivity
of the (Functional) Hill diversity measure to the relative frequencies
of compounds. For q = 0 compound proportions are not taken into account.
For q = 1 compounds are weighed according to their proportion in the sample.
For q = 2, more weight is put on compounds with high proportions.}
}
\value{
Data frame with calculated diversity/evenness for each sample.
}
