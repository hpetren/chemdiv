# chemdiv

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

chemdiv is an in development R package to analyse phytochemical data.

The package can be used to calculate various types of diversities and
dissimilarities for phytochemical datasets. It is possible to take the
biosynthetic/structural properties of the phytochemical compounds into
account while performing these calculations, resulting in comprehensive
measures of phytochemical diversity.

## Installation

The developmental version of the package can be installed directly from
GitHub in R using the `install_github` function from the devtools
package.

``` r
# Install devtools if not already installed
install.packages("devtools")

library("devtools")

install_github("hpetren/chemdiv")
```

## Usage

Detailed usage notes can be found with `help(chemdiv)` and in the
documentation for each function. In short, two types of data is
required. First, a dataset on the relative proportions of different
chemical compounds in different samples. Second, a dataset with the
name, SMILES and InChIKey of all the compounds found in the samples.

#### Compound classification and dissimilarities

Function `NPCTable` uses NPClassifier to classify chemical compounds.
Function `compDis` calculates dissimilarity matrices between chemical
compounds based on their biosynthetic and/or structural properties. Note
that `compDis` outputs a list with one or several matrices.

#### Diversity calculations

Functions `calcDiv`, `calcBetaDiv` and `calcDivProf` are used to
calculate different kinds of (alpha)-diversity and evenness (`calcDiv`),
beta-diversity (`calcBetaDiv`) and diversity profiles (`calcDivProf`)
for the samples. The matrix generated by `compDis` can be included in
these analyses.

#### Sample dissimilarities

Function `sampleDis` is used to calculate Generalized UniFrac
dissimilarities or Bray-Curtis dissimilarities between samples. The
matrix generated by `compDis` can be included in these analyses.

#### Molecular network and properties

Function `molNet` creates a molecular network of the chemical compounds
and calculates some network properties. Uses the matrix generated by
`compDis`.

#### Chemodiversity and network plots

`molNetPlot` and `chemDivPlot` are used to conveniently create basic
plots of the molecular network and different types of chemodiversity
measurements created by various functions in the package.

#### Shortcut function

Function `quickChemDiv` uses many of the other functions in the package
to in one simple step visualize chemodiversity for users wanting to
quickly explore their data using standard parameters.
